# Reflection

**Which AI tool(s) did you use?**  
I used ChatGPT to help generate part of the HTML (Hero Section) and part of the CSS (Hero Section styling).

**How did it help you?**  
The AI tool gave me starter code that I could copy and paste. It helped me structure my landing page faster and saved me from having to learn everything from scratch.

**What challenges did you encounter?**  
I had to understand how to link the CSS file to the HTML and how to push files to GitHub. At first, it was confusing, but once I followed step-by-step instructions it made more sense.

**What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?**  
I learned that AI can be a helpful assistant, but you still need to understand how to organize your files and test your code. AI is not perfect, but it can speed up the process and make coding more approachable.
